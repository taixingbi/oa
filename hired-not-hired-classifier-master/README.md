# Task:
Hired/not-hired classifier for pokemon trainers.

## question 1 
Here is [code1](https://github.com/taixingbi/hired-not-hired-classifier/blob/master/question1.ipynb) 

      Based Z Score for Population Proportion, find out (Kanto, Nurse) is the most competitive team.     

## question 2&3 
Here is [code2](https://github.com/taixingbi/hired-not-hired-classifier/blob/master/question2%263.ipynb)       
      
      Step1 handle missing value.  

      Step2 fix imbalance datasets using combing SMOTE + Tomek  

      Step3 feature importance based on random forest.      

      Step4 compare the models between random forest(RF) and XGBoost. achieve good accuracy of RF:    
            accuracy: 99.11%    
            precision: 99.73%    
            recall: 98.50%    
            fscore: 99.11%    
            rocauc score: 99.72%     


      step5 use the trained model to predict new data.    

## Other
libaray need to be installed [here](https://github.com/taixingbi/hired-not-hired-classifier/blob/master/requirements.txt).
